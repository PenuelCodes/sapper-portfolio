        valuable lessons to apply for yourself.

        I'm sure you're already subscribed to plenty of newsletters, and you're
        worried that this will be another one you sign up for and never read.
        That won't be the case. My goal is to make you look forward to each and
        every issue, because it'll contain so much value and actionable advice
        that you'd be foolish not to read it. That's a high bar, but it's what
        I'm striving to hit whenever I send an email to you.
