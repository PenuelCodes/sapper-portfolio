      I get this question a lot. Coding is a difficult field, and it can be very
      overwhelming when you're early in your career. There's so much stuff to
      learn, so many possible areas to focus on, and how on Earth are you
      supposed to land a job without any experience?
    </p>

    <p>
      I've been a developer for several years now, and I still get overwhelmed
      sometimes. But I've also learned a lot of valuable lessons that has helped
      me make tremendous progress in a short amount of time.
    </p>

    <p>
      A lot of the difficulties we encounter when learning to code is because
      our mindset isn't right. Coding is unique, and so it takes time for our brains to adjust to the field.
    </p>

    <p>
      But once we do, we're able to improve our skills, be more productive, deal
      with self-doubt, land a job, and actually solve problems for real people
      and businesses. All while earning good money, too!
