      I get this question a lot. Coding is a difficult field, and it can feel
      overwhelming - especially early in your career. There's so much to
      learn, so many areas to focus on, and how are you
      supposed to land a job without any experience?
    </p>

    <p>
      I've been a developer for several years now, and I still get overwhelmed. But I've also learned valuable lessons that has helped
      me make tremendous progress in a short amount of time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of the difficulties we encounter when learning to code is because
      our mindset isn't right. Coding is unique, so it takes time for our brains to adjust.
    </p>

    <p>
      But once it does, we're able to improve our skills, be more productive, deal
      with self-doubt, land a job, and actually solve problems for real people
      and businesses. All while earning good money, too!
    </p>

    <p>
      That is why I wrote this book. I want to help you reframe your
      mindset, through tactical advice and effective practices. This book shares
      everything I know about being a professional developer, improving your
      skills, and landing your dream development job.
		</p>
		<p>Jam-packed with actionable
      advice and real-world experiences, I want to help you be the best
      developer you can be.</p>
