    “How do I get better at coding and land a development job?”
  </h2>

  <p>
    I get this question a lot. Coding is a difficult field, and it can be very
    overwhelming when you're early in your career. There's so much stuff to
    learn, so many possible areas to focus on, and how on Earth are you supposed
    to land a job without any experience?
  </p>

  <p>
    I've been a developer for several years now, and I still get overwhelmed
    sometimes. But I've also learned a lot of valuable lessons that has helped
    me make tremendous progress in a short amount of time.
  </p>

  <p>
    A lot of the difficulties we encounter when learning to code is because our
    mindset isn't quite right. Coding is very unique, and so it takes a while
    for our brains to adjust to the field.
  </p>

  <p>
    But once we do, we're able to improve our skills, be more productive, deal
    with self-doubt, land a job, and actually solve problems for real people and
    businesses.
  </p>

  <p>

    mindset, through tactical advice and effective practices. This book shares
    everything I know about being a professional developer, improving your
    skills, and landing your dream development job. Jam-packed with actionable
