      <p class="font-bold text-lg xl:text-xl">Who is this book for?</p>
      <p>
        This book is written to any person who works with code, as part of their
        job or on their own time. All of the content is field-agnostic, meaning
        it will benefit you regardless of your exact area of interest. If you're
        a front-end developer, back-end developer, app maker, data scientist,
        DevOps engineer, or you just want to get better at coding: this book is
        for you. Most of the examples are related to front-end development, as
        that is my personal expertise - but there's definitely something for
        everyone.

        Will I learn anything as a junior / newbie developer?
      </p>
      <p>
        Absolutely yes! The book is largely written with new developers in mind,
        or people that are early in their coding career. The book also features
        a lot of valuable advice on how to land a development job, especially if
        it's your first one.
