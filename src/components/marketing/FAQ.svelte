			<p class="font-bold text-lg xl:text-xl">Who is this book for?</p>
			<p>
				This book is written to any person who works with code, as part of their
				job or on their own time. All of the content is field-agnostic, meaning
				it will benefit you regardless of your focus area. If you're a front-end
				developer, back-end developer, app maker, data scientist, DevOps
				engineer, or you just want to get better at developing: this book is for
				you. Most of the examples are related to front-end development, as that
				is my personal expertise, but I've worked hard to make sure everyone can
				use the book.

				Will I learn anything as a junior / newbie developer?
			</p>
			<p>
				Absolutely yes! The book is largely written with new developers in mind,
				or people that are early in their coding career. The book also features
				a lot of valuable advice on how to land a development job, especially if
				it's your first one.
